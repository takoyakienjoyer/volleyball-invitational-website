      icon="i-heroicons-book-open"
      description="The Lincoln-Way Invitational began in 1992 during the inaugural IHSA season for boys volleyball in Illinois. The invite was created by Maggie Jager, the first boys volleyball coach at Lincoln-Way. Over 30 years later it remains a prestigious event, regularly hosting the best boys volleyball programs from the Midwest. As the oldest boys volleybAll-Tournament in Illinois, it began with a 16-team field and expanded to 24 in 2012. In 2002 Lincoln-Way split into two separate high schools, East and Central. At that point the tournament was renamed the Lincoln-Way East Invitational. Annually the invite is held at the East and Central/West campuses. Since itâ€™s expansion to 24 teams Lincoln-Way East has won the most titles with 4, followed by Glenbard West with 2."
